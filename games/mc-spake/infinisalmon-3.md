*InfiniSalmon 3* is the sequel to [*InfiniSalmon 2*]({% link games/mc-spake/infinisalmon-2.md %}) and the final entry in the InfiniSalmon series. Tonally and structurally, it's quite a departure from the previous two entries - rather than an adventure in a large open valley, it's a walk through a series of dimly-lit, wet, and overgrown tunnels.

The first part of the map has the player traversing a broken-down version of the house that appears at the start of *InfiniSalmon 2*, revisiting the characters that appeared in that map. Afterwards, the plot continues through a series of journals left by the TheMint. Uniquely, this map actually ends with an unbeatable boss, something that only occurs again in [*Focused Location*]({% link games/mc-spake/focused-location.md %}). The map's ending is also far-removed from any of the other endings, in that the player actually seems to die and go to heaven.

Yep, you read that right. This map's name is *Map*. And as the name suggests, this map (as well as its sequels, [*Map 2*]({% link games/mc-spake/map-2.md %}) and [*Voidborders*]({% link games/mc-spake/voidborders.md %})) has very few qualms with breaking the fourth-wall every opportunity it gets, to the point where the plot is almost completely incomprehensible.

The Map series draws a lot of inspiration from [CDFDMAN](https://twitter.com/cdfdman)'s *Exponential Experiences* series of maps, which are also very fourth-wally in that they feature the map creator as a character and poke fun at bad map-making. *Map* in specific draws much inspiration from [Lift 9](https://www.minecraftmaps.com/adventure-maps/exponential-experiences-lift-9).

Other than that, *Map* contains many references to [Jesper the End](https://twitter.com/jespertheend?lang=en)'s now-defunct server, commonly known as [JTES](https://jtes.fandom.com/wiki/Jesper_The_End%27s_server_Wiki), which is where 2015 me spent a lot of his free time just playing minigames and talking to friends. For example, the Datenegassie character, who makes more appearances later in the *Map* and *Focused Location* series, draws his name from [the real Datenegassie](https://twitter.com/Datenegassie_) whom I met at this server. A subsection of the JTES lobby also makes an appearance at the very end of the map.

In addition, the villain Je22, who later becomes the main antagonist of the SpakeMiner universe, takes his name from Jesper the End's old alt account username. His personality is based off a couple of funny interactions I had with him, among them that (if I recall correctly) after jokingly implying one time that Je22 was Jesper's "evil clone," Je22 /kill'd me. I've attached below a screenshot from what I believe is the actual (hair-clenchingly horrifying) event, dated September 27th, 2014, as well as a screenshot of the actual original Je22, dated 16 days later:

In summary, if it wasn't clear already, this map was basically one big and very obscure shitpost, basically combining everything Minecraft-related that I was into at the time in a manner somehow both self-aware and not self-aware.

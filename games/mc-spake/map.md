Yep, you read that right. This map's name is *Map*. And as the name suggests, this map (as well as its sequels, [*Map 2*]({% link games/mc-spake/map-2.md %}) and [*Voidborders*]({% link games/mc-spake/voidborders.md %})) has very few qualms with breaking the fourth-wall every opportunity it gets, to the point where the plot is almost completely incomprehensible.

The Map series draws a lot of inspiration from [CDFDMAN](https://twitter.com/cdfdman)'s *Exponential Experiences* series of maps, which are also very fourth-wally in that they feature the map creator as a character and poke fun at bad map-making. *Map* in specific draws much inspiration from [Lift 9](https://www.minecraftmaps.com/adventure-maps/exponential-experiences-lift-9).

Other than that, *Map* contains many references to [Jesper the End](https://twitter.com/jespertheend?lang=en)'s now-defunct server, commonly known as [JTES](https://jtes.fandom.com/wiki/Jesper_The_End%27s_server_Wiki), which is where 2015 me spent a lot of his free time just playing minigames and talking to friends. For example, the Datenegassie character, who makes more appearances later in the *Map* and *Focused Location* series, draws his name from [the real Datenegassie](https://twitter.com/Datenegassie_) who I met at this server. The villain, Je22, also takes his name from Jesper the End's old alt account username. Finally, a subsection of the JTES lobby makes an appearance at the very end of the map.

In summary, if it wasn't clear already, this map was basically one big and very obscure shitpost, basically combining everything Minecraft-related that I was into at the time in a manner somehow both self-aware and not self-aware.

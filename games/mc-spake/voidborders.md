*Voidborders* is the sequel to [*Map 2*]({% link games/mc-spake/map-2.md %}). As the final entry in the Map series, it's an odd one at that - it's the only one to feature an actual non-ironic map, at least partially.

The first part of the map presents a legitimate story about a criminal escaping prison and going on an adventure to find the Voidborders, a legendary realm found underneath the void. This dimension doesn't actually appear within the map, although it is shown and expanded upon in [*Focused Location 2*]({% link games/mc-spake/focused-location-2.md %}).

The second part, much shorter than the first, is a segment very similar to the first two entries in the Map series, with exposed redstone, constant fourth-wall breaking, and ending with a fight against Je22. The second part isn't really related to the first one - story-wise, the first part is supposed to be a beta version of a map that was being built in *Map 2*, and the second part is the behind-the-scenes redstone area of that map.

The first part also contains a pretty extensive reference to the puzzle game Portal 2, including a trip into a parody version of Aperture Labs called Aperture Lemon Innovators.

Like *Map 2*, *Voidborders* doesn't expand much on the SpakeMiner universe lore. It does introduce one character, Caroline the Witch (simply named "Witch" in this map), who makes an appearance later in [*Focused Location 3*]({% link games/mc-spake/focused-location-3.md %}).

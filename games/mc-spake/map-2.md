*Map 2* is the sequel to [*Map*]({% link games/mc-spake/map.md %}). It continues the surreal, self-ironic themes of *Map*, as well as the very vague story that began in it (mostly revolving around SpakeMiner's maps and the struggle against the antagonist Je22).

I won't sugarcoat it - *Map 2* kinda sucks. It's by far the shortest of the SpakeMiner maps, and from what I know it doesn't even function properly. The currently-published version has a section that is mandatory to complete the map which is, as far as I know, completely broken.

Fortunately, *Map 2* also doesn't really contribute much to the "mythos", other than kind of setting up [*Voidborders*]({% link games/mc-spake/voidborders.md %}), so the fact that it's incompletable isn't too much of a problem. If you're curious, the section that comes after the incompletable part is just that Je22 shows up, traps you, and then a boss fight ensues with him (pretty much the same ending as any of the other entries in the Map series).

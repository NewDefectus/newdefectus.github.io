I won't sugarcoat it - *Map 2* kinda sucks. It's by far the shortest of the SpakeMiner maps, and from what I know it doesn't even function properly. The currently-published version has a section that is mandatory to complete the map, which is, as far as I know, completely broken.

Fortunately, *Map 2* also doesn't really contribute much to the "mythos", other than kind of setting up [Voidborders]({% link games/mc-spake/voidborders.md %}), so the fact that it is incompletable isn't too much of a problem. If you're curious, the section that comes after the incompletable part is just that Je22 shows up, traps you, and then a boss fight ensues with him (pretty much the same ending as any of the other entries in the Map series).

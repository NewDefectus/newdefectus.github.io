InfiniSalmon is the first Minecraft adventure map I made. It's also the first entry in the InfiniSalmon series, which includes the sequels [*InfiniSalmon 2*]({% link games/mc-spake/infinisalmon-2.md %}) and [*3*]({% link games/mc-spake/infinisalmon-3.md %}). I made *InfiniSalmon* when I was 11 years old, and I dedicated it to my real-life cat Skipper, who features prominently in the map (and who also appears as a minor character in the sequels).

*InfiniSalmon* is a short map where you, playing as a night guard, venture into a valley to retrieve an artifact called the InfiniSalmon - a piece of cooked salmon that can be eaten forever. Along the way you run through a forest, a cave, and a Guardian lair, dodging and killing monsters you come across.

*InfiniSalmon* enjoyed a brief surge in popularity 6 months after its release, when it was featured on the French website [minecraft.fr](https://minecraft.fr/infinisalmon/). The map was also the centerpiece of a controversy I got myself caught in in mid-2016, which eventually led me to change my username to Defectus.

*Focused Location 2* is the sequel to [*Focused Location*]({% link games/mc-spake/focused-location.md %}). There's really not a lot to talk about here - it's a simple prison escape plot, with some cool sequences in between, like going to the actual Voidborders dimension first mentioned in [*Voidborders*]({% link games/mc-spake/voidborders.md %}), with the portal becoming a talking supporting character. All the main characters from past SpakeMiner maps, including SpakeMiner, Alfred, Datenegassie, Fog, and Je22, make an appearance in this map; TheMint also returns after seemingly being killed in [*InfiniSalmon 3*]({% link games/mc-spake/infinisalmon-3.md %}).

The boss section in this map is pretty neat - it consists of the player going through the redstone areas of each of the previous maps in the SpakeMiner universe, fighting Je22's followers (named "Invaders" after their nickname in the *Focused Location* airplane fight) and deactivating "/kill @e clocks," devices planted by Je22 that can destroy these maps. Je22's motives are also explored a little further in this map, but not to any particularly interesting capacity.

The ending of the map, as well as the plot of the subsequent [*Focused Location 3*]({% link games/mc-spake/focused-location-3.md %}), was largely inspired by the final few episodes of Gravity Falls, with Je22 destroying the terminal while possessing SpakeMiner being a direct mirror of [Bill Cipher breaking the rift while possessing Blendin Blandin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhVIKhHl2ws). You'll see a lot more of these parallels between Je22 and Bill Cipher in *Focused Location 3*.

Funnily enough, two days before *Focused Location 2*'s release, I also published an [April Fools release](https://www.planetminecraft.com/project/adventure-map-focused-location-ii-age-of-chains/) on Planet Minecraft. It didn't have anything too interesting, just a few seconds of fake dialogue followed by the troll song.

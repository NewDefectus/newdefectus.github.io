*Focused Location 3* is the sequel to [*Focused Location 2*]({% link games/mc-spake/focused-location.md %}) and the final published map in the SpakeMiner universe. As the de facto finale to the series, it contains numerous references to past maps and characters, including the Temple of Organism from [*InfiniSalmon 2*]({% link games/mc-spake/infinisalmon-2.md %}), the potion-selling witch from [*Voidborders*]({% link games/mc-spake/voidborders.md %}) (now named Caroline, who has refurbished her lair into a potion shop), the Tower of Void from *Focused Location 2*, and the long-foreshadowed Ocean Monument, a gigantic guardian lair.

*Focused Location 3* picks up immediately where *Focused Location 2* ended - with all the characters out of prison and Je22 having broken SpakeMiner's terminal. Having gained operator powers consequently, Je22 begins the "Je22 Apocalypse", a spoof of Weirdmageddon from Gravity Falls (If you've read the article on *Focused Location 2* you'll know this map has lots of parallels between Je22 and Bill Cipher).

The main characters fall to the Pyramid of Organism from [*InfiniSalmon 2*]({% link games/mc-spake/infinisalmon-2.md %}), where they, together with the Voidborders portal from *Focused Location 2*, concoct a plan to defeat him by having Je22 enter the player's head and become trapped in the void under the Redstone Hall, a structure that originated in [*Map*]({% link games/mc-spake/map.md %}) and has appeared numerous times in the Focused Location series (this is another kind of allusion to Bill Cipher, specifically how he gets killed off in the series finale).

The group first hunt for the InfiniSalmon, which is now in the possession of a Guardian called Julian, who has taken over Fog's kingdom. Fog also now joins the group after Je22 betrayed him. The player, having been transformed into a fish in Voidborders' special submarine OLIS, sneaks into the Ocean Monument and defeats Julian, taking the InfiniSalmon and feeding the group.

Afterwards, the player returns to the witch from [*Voidborders*]({% link games/mc-spake/infinisalmon-2.md %}), now called Caroline, who has refurbished her shop. The player helps her disable a /kill @e clock planted by Je22 and receives potions of invisibility from her, which the supporting characters use to sneak with the player into Je22's lair.

In the final showdown, the player and Je22 face off in an expanded version of the Redstone Hall called the Redstone Sphere. In here the boss music that plays was specially written by [Green Greeny](https://soundcloud.com/green-greeny), whose music (originally intended for CDFDMAN) I'd been using throughout many of the SpakeMiner maps. This track in particular, called [Alien TakeOver](https://soundcloud.com/green-greeny/alien-takeover-falling-to-the-grid-remix), is a remix of another track of his called [Falling to the Grid](https://soundcloud.com/green-greeny/falling-to-the-grid), which has played up until now every time the Redstone Hall has appeared.

Despite most of the plot up until now being a Weirdmageddon homage, the actual defeat of Je22 is a reenactment of the [Portal 2 ending](https://youtu.be/4xdMOAQulqg?t=91), with Je22 (Wheatley) being sucked into the void (space) while the player holds onto them. Even the appropriate track from the Portal 2 OST plays as this happens.

In terms of significant events happening I think *Focused Location 3* is the most interesting map, even though relative to the other SpakeMiner maps it has a lot of uninterrupted dialogue. It's definitely a fitting conclusion to the SpakeMiner universe, having constant references to previous events and wrapping up many of the stories. Of course, after the credits roll, there is a teaser for the next map in the series, [Section 7]({% link games/mc-spake/section-7.md %}), which never came out. I'm not sure it would've even fit to have another map in the series though.

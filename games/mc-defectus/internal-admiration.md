*Internal Admiration* is the final map I made as Defectus (and in general). It's a short, surreal, [Stanley Parable](https://www.stanleyparable.com/)-like adventure exploring the idea of superiority and importance.

It's one of the maps I'm much less proud of. It's extremely brief and abstract and it doesn't really have a concrete point. I think it was just me experimenting with the 1.12 features until I got bored and just finished it. I really don't know how much you'll get out of it. The dialogue system is pretty cool, and how abstract (in a similar vein to [*What It's Like*]({% link games/mc-defectus/what-its-like.md %})) it is might be appealing, but it's mostly just philosophical ramblings.

In retrospect though, I think if the map was longer and just had more stuff, it might've been a nice experience. Really its biggest undoing is its runtime (around 4 minutes). I think I just got sick of the idea as I was making it, but still wanted to publish what I had already made.

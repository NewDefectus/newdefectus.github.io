*Internal Admiration* is the final map I made as Defectus (and in general). It's one of the maps I'm much less proud of. It's extremely brief and abstract and it doesn't really have a concrete point. I think it was just me experimenting with the 1.12 features until I got bored and just finished it.

I really don't know how much you'll get out of this map. The dialogue system is pretty cool, and how abstract (in a similar vein to [*What It's Like*]({% link games/mc-defectus/what-its-like.md %})) it is might be appealing, but it's mostly just philosophical ramblings.

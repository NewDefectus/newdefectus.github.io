The Last Fix is a 2D platforming game I'm working on with my best friend Yoav Shita (aka mishdif). The game is developed by me in the [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) engine, with assets being created by mishdif in [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/).

In the game you play as a plumber who, equipped with a grappling hook, swings around a city at night to fix various objects. The game's layout is meant to evoke [Celeste](https://www.celestegame.com/), although the story is very different in tone.

On October 1st 2023, we released the first version of the game's demo, which contains the first few levels of the game. The current version of the demo (v0.1.1) can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16nFJvFiVTw4zwCMSJPn_bkwxmlqB1_ck/view?usp=sharing).

This project is currently under a temporary hiatus. If you have any questions about it feel free to contact me :)

The Last Fix is a 2D platforming game I'm currently working on with my best friend Yoav Shita (aka mishdif). The game is developed by me in the [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) engine, with assets being created by mishdif in [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/).

In the game you play as a plumber who, equipped with a grappling hook, swings around a city at night to fix various objects. The game's layout is meant to evoke [Celeste](https://www.celestegame.com/), although the planned story is very different in tone.

I've attached a demo of the currently playable version of the game below:

Hi! I'm Alon Ran (aka Defectus). Welcome to my website! :D

This is where I collect and categorize all of my creative works, including stories, games, and programming projects.

You might notice that some of the works here are marked with a star (⭐). This is reserved for works that I'm especially proud of, typically because they took a lot of time to make. If you're just browsing around I'd recommend you look out for these.
